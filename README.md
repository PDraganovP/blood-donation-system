Simple web application example which main purpose is to connect blood donation centers
with people ready to help with  their blood donations. Initial commit in the repository
include entities, repositories, services and their implementations, models, controllers,
few tests and frond-end programming. Main reason for this initial commit is that I have 
created this web application months before this github repository. Now I'll use this base 
for improvements and future development of the web application.
